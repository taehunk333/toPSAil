% Base Case Simulation
% Purpose: 
%	- to validate toPSAil's simulation capabilities against	the 
%         most challenging (numerically) simulation problem for an 
%	  equilibrium PSA process.

%		low pressure
%	- case_study_1.10.x:
%		1-adsorber, isothermal, flow-driven, time-driven, 
%		linear isotherm, LDF kinetics, O2-N2-Zeolite_5A, a 
%		single counter-current repressurization with the feed,

% Plots:
% 	- Pressure profiles (vs. time) for the two adsorption columns
%	- Adsorbed phase concentration of the 1st adsorber at the last
%	  high pressure feed step, before reaching a CSS
% 	- A comparison of the gas phase concentration profiles in the
% 	  1st adsorber, as a function of the number of CSTRs (n_c)
% Data: 
%	- Data for the CPU times/cycle (4 PSA cycle simulations and 
%	  take the average over 10 PSA cycles)
%	- Oxygen recovery %, and  Oxygen purity for the different 
%	  simulations of Kayser's system over different n_c values
