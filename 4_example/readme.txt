% Base Case Simulation
% Purpose: 
%	- to validate toPSAil's simulation capabilities against	the 
%         most challenging (numerically) simulation problem for an 
%	  equilibrium PSA process system.
% Case Studies:
% 	- case_study_1.0: 2-adsorber, isothermal, flow-controlled, 
%		          time-driven O2-N2-Zeolite_5A.
%			  Reference: Kayser (1986)
% Plots:
% 	- Pressure profiles (vs. time) for the two adsorption columns
%	- Adsorbed phase concentration of the 1st adsorber at the last
%	  high pressure feed step, before reaching a CSS
% 	- A comparison of the gas phase concentration profiles in the
% 	  1st adsorber, as a function of the number of CSTRs (n_c)
% Data: 
%	- Data for the CPU times/cycle (4 PSA cycle simulations and 
%	  take the average over 10 PSA cycles), Oxygen recovery %, and
% 	  Oxygen purity for the different simulations of Kayser's 
%	  system over different n_c values

% Single Adsorber Simulation I
% Purpose:
%	- to compare the isothermal vs. nonisothermal adsorbed phase 
%	  concentration profiles, as well as events vs. no events
% 	- to demonstrate an acceleration to a CSS, using the event 
% 	  functions and flow-driven vs. pressure-driven 
% Case Studies:
% 	- case_study_2.1: case_study_1.0 with 1 adsorber.
%			  Reference: Kayser (1986)
% 	- case_study_2.2: case_study_2.1 with the event-driven mode.
%			  Reference: Kayser (1986)
% 	- case_study_2.3: case_study_2.1 with nonisothermal operation.
%			  Reference: Kayser (1986)
%	- case_study_2.4: case_study_2.3 with the event-driven mode.
